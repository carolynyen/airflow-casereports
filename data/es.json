measured as 500 ms one month after birth, while the QTc of his sister (III-2) was 530 ms at birth.\nThe father (I-1) and mother (I-2) of the proband were first cousins.\nThere is no history of sudden unexplained syncope or death of children or adults in the immediate family members, despite the prolonged QTc of the children.\nClinical evaluation and consultation of the proband and her family members were performed at Chiba University Hospital.\nClinical phenotypes were deduced from the clinical history, physical examinations, and ECG.\nBlood samples were collected from the proband and her family members following genetic counseling, and written informed consent was obtained prior to sample collection.\nGenomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes according to established protocols at our laboratory [19].\nEntire coding exons, including the intronic boundaries of the genes, of KCNQ1 (NCBI ref: NM_000218) and other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), according to established protocols in our laboratory.\nBriefly, 30\u2013100 ng of genomic DNA was subjected to PCR amplification with DNA polymerase (PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase; Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Japan) and primer sets.\nThe amplicons were subjected to conventional sequencing with Sanger sequencers (Applied Biosystems 3730/3130 DNA analyzers; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\nThe sequence data were processed with Gene Codes Sequencher Software (Takara Bio Inc.) and mapped to the human genome sequence (build GRCh37/hg19).\nGenetic analysis was performed to screen all coding exons and the exon\u2013intron boundaries of the KCNQ1 gene (NCBI ref: NM_000218.2, NP_000209.2) with concurrent screening of other LQT causative genes (KCNH2, SCN5A, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, SCN4B, KCNJ5).\nWe detected a novel homozygous nonsense variant, NM_000218.2:c.115G\u2009>\u2009T (p.Glu39X, in exon 1a), in the KCNQ1 gene of the proband, as well as a homozygous common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C\u2009>\u2009G, p.Pro448Arg) (Additional file 1: Table S1).\nGenetic screening of her mother (I-2) and children (III-1 and III-2) revealed that they were heterozygous for the nonsense variant (Fig.2).\nHer husband (II-3) was also screened and found to be heterozygous for the common variant (NM_000218.2:c.1343C\u2009>\u2009G, p.Pro448Arg).\nThe proband is a child from a first-cousin marriage, and we have concluded the homozygous nonsense variant in the proband is the cause of her JLNS1.\nThe proband was negative for pathogenic variants in other LQT causative genes, including the KCNE1 gene (Additional file 1: Table S1)."}}, {"_index": "casereport", "_type": "_doc", "_id":

markedly elevated parathyroid hormone level of 286\u2005pg/mL, so the patient was referred to otolaryngology for further evaluation.\nThyroid ultrasound showed a hypoechoic nodule in the left lower lobe of the thyroid.\nCT scan of the neck revealed a 2\u2005cm hypodense nodule on the posterior inferior aspect of the left lower thyroid and sestamibi scan showed increased uptake along the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe.\nElevated PTH along with an aberrant parathyroid gland on imaging suggests primary hyperparathyroidism.\nHistorically, hyperparathyroidism is associated with bone disease, renal stones and neuromuscular dysfunction, however, with the current screening modalities, most patients are caught early and often asymptomatic.3 Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a parathyroid adenoma.\nInfrequent causes include parathyroid hyperplasia, which would affect all four glands and rarely caused by parathyroid carcinoma.\nMarkedly elevated serum PTH and calcium levels leading to severe renal and bone manifestations are helpful in the diagnosis of cancer, however, it is usually discovered operatively based on local invasion and metastases.3\nThe primary indication for parathyroidectomy, historically, is for symptomatic patients.\nCurrently, since most patients are caught earlier, there are newer indications for surgery.\nThese include an asymptomatic patient with any of the following: glomerular filtration rate <60\u2005mL/min, bone density T-score <\u22122.5 at any site and/or previous fractures, age <50, and serum calcium 1.0\u2005ng/dL above the upper limit of normal.3 This patient presented with pain, markedly elevated PTH, and was younger than 50\u2005years old, so it was decided that surgery was the best choice in management.\nThe patient was brought to the operating room and underwent a parathyroidectomy.\nThe surgeon found the parathyroid gland to be firm and densely adherent to the thyroid capsule and overlying strap muscle, making it difficult to dissect.\nThere was no visible invasion into the capsule, surrounding muscle or regional lymph nodes.\nThe resected specimen was noted to be brownish grey in colour with scattered necrotic foci, and irregular texture.\nOn postoperative pathology, the specimen was confirmed positive for parathyroid carcinoma with capsular invasion, focal tumour necrosis, reactive fibrosis and local skeletal muscle invasion (figures 1 and \u200b2).\nMargins were resected.\nImmunohistochemical stains showed increased Ki-67 reactivity as well as strong Bcl-1 (cyclin D1) reactivity, which support the diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma (figure 3).\nAdditionally, P57 staining was negative.\nAlthough most reports of parathyroid carcinomas are associated with marked hypercalcaemia, non-functioning cancers in patients tend to behave more aggressively.1 Owing to the severity and uncertainty of the lesion, the patient was followed up postoperatively for repeat imaging to determine if residual tumour remained.\nRepeat sestamibi and positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed residual activity along the surgical area so the patient subsequently underwent a second operation for a radical left neck dissection and left hemithyroidectomy.\nThe patient recovered very well postoperatively and it has now been 3\u2005years since the second surgery.\nThe patient continues to do very well and is followed up every 3\u2005months to monitor serum PTH and calcium levels.\nShe no longer reports of neck and shoulder pain.\nSometimes the

prolactinoma.\nThe patient underwent transnasal transsphenoidal surgery to remove the tumor and relieve the compression of the optic nerve.\nIntraoperatively, it was seen that the tumor invaded and filled the left interval of the sphenoid sinus, and part of bone in sellar floor and left side parasellar was destroyed and absorbed.\nA little normal pituitary tissue was seen in the top right of tumor in the sellar turcica.\nThe tumor was reddish black with extremely rich blood supply and had close adhesion to the surrounding structure.\nThe texture in the center of the tumor was soft and much tougher over the rim.\nIntraoperative frozen-section examination found melanin granules, and it was considered to be malignant melanoma or meningioma.\nThe tumor cells were composed of eosinophilic staining epithelial cells.\nMost of cell nuclei were round, a few were reniform and hippocrepiform with evident nucleoli, and nuclear fission was seen.\nThe tumor showed no evidence of necrosis (Fig.2).\nThe tumor was immunopositive focally for melanoma-specific markers such as S-100, HMB45, and Vimentin, and immunopositive for neuroendocrine tumor markers such as CgA and Syn (Fig.3).\nThe Ki67 index was 3% to 5%; it was higher in metastatic melanoma than in the adenomatous component.\nTaken the melanoma history and suspected lymph node and hepatic metastasis into consideration, the patient was diagnosised with MMPA.\nAfter surgery, significant relief was seen in visual field and headache, and the level of prolactin, cortisol, and FT4 returned to normal with hormone replacement therapy.\nBecause the focal liver lesions and lymphadenectasis did not cause much discomfort, the patient refused any further surgical intervention or other treatment.\nShe was discharged from the hospital immediately and was disease free until 2 months after the third surgery.\nThe patient successively found new melanoma metastatic sites in the skin of lower left leg, knees, the upper left leg, the left groin and the right groin, and the right leg.\nAt the follow-up in late January 2016, the patient could not walk and live by herself and was depressed.\nAt the

costal fractures, fracture of the L3 vertebral body and the transverse process, and displaced fractures of the right clavicle.\nThat hospitalization had lasted 40 days, during which time the clinicians had not detected any murmur or requested a cardiac evaluation.\nThe patient returned to normal activities 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital and remained asymptomatic for one

by suboptimal acoustic windows, revealed severe, eccentric mitral regurgitation.\nThe valvular and subvalvular apparatus appeared to be structurally normal, and the left atrium was only mildly dilated.\nThe patient was treated with intravenous diuretics until the signs and symptoms of congestion were relieved.\nCoronary angiography revealed an absence of substantial coronary disease.\nWe therefore planned an elective surgical procedure for mitral valve repair.\nSurgical Procedure.\nDuring intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), we observed both a trivial central mitral regurgitant jet and a severe perivalvular regurgitant jet, this last originating from a ventriculoatrial fistulous communication behind the P1 scallop (Fig.1).\nFurther examination confirmed the absence of structural disease involving the mitral leaflets or subvalvular apparatus.\nAfter surgical exposure of the mitral valve, a small tear (length, 6\u20137 mm) could be seen behind the posterior leaflet, in a lateral position, involving also the annulus and the left atrial wall.\nThe absence of leaflet abnormalities or vegetations suggested the posttraumatic origin of the perivalvular leak.\nValvular repair was successfully achieved by direct suture of the tear with three 5-0 Prolene stitches and by the subsequent insertion of a 30-mm mitral annuloplasty ring.\nThe

operation had significantly reduced the frequency of her symptoms and for several years her epistaxis was under control with the use of low dose thalidomide.\nHowever, she was referred to our clinic due to increased epistaxis severity and frequency over the prior 12 months necessitating more frequent transfusions.\nAt the time of consultation the patient was concerned about daily severe left

of our consultation was 75 g/L (normal\u2009=\u2009120 \u2013 160 g/L).\nHer HHT epistaxis severity score [17] was severe (normalized score 9.49).\nOn examination, she had multiple telangiectasia on her fingers, face, lips and palate.\nHer endoscopic examination revealed bilateral telangiectasia along the nasal septum.\nThere was extensive crusting along the entire left nasal cavity with which any manipulation resulted in immediate profuse epistaxis.\nGiven the severity of the patient\u2019s epistaxis despite medical therapy, she was offered endoscopic left-sided septodermoplasty.\nThe surgical goals were to improve her quality of life by reducing the number and severity of epistaxis episodes while diminishing the need for blood transfusions.\nThe patient was content with the treatment plan and agreed to undergo surgical intervention.\nThe endoscopic procedure was performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.\nThe nasal cavity was prepared by inserting pledgets soaked in topical adrenaline (1:1000) placed in both nostrils for decongestion.\nUsing a zero degree endoscope the residual STSG and mucosa of the left septum was dissected in a supraperichondrial plane that resulted in the expected significant diffuse hemorrhage.\nImmediate hemostasis was attained using a topical gelatin-thrombin matrix, Floseal (FloSeal Hemostatic Matrix; Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) (Fig.1).\nThe mucosal defect (Fig.2) measured approximately 3 cm in anterior-posterior dimension.\nA 4 x 2 cm split thickness skin graft was harvested from the right thigh, pie-crusted with a 15 blade and then placed endoscopically along the length of the septal defect.\nAs seen in Fig.3, the graft was placed with an overlap of the mucosa of the nasal floor and the residual superior septal mucosa.\nFinally, 2 mL of fibrin sealant (TISSEEL fibrin sealant, Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, USA) was then applied first to the edges then central portion of the STSG (Fig.4).\nPacking was not used post-operatively and the patient was discharged home on the same day of surgery.\nClinical follow-up two weeks after surgery (Fig.5) showed that the entire graft had taken and the left-sided epistaxis had dramatically diminished.\nThe patient was very content with the results of the procedure.\nAt 6 months follow-up, her baseline hemoglobin had improved to 102 g/L and she was requiring transfusions every 4 months with her hematologist\u2019s intent to stop the transfusions if her hemoglobin remained greater than 100

tachycardia (VT) and hypertension presented to the Emergency Department with continuous palpitation, chest tightness, profuse sweating and nausea with no obvious predisposing causes.\nThe patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and acute confusion.\nAfter an immediate electrical conversion, his consciousness was gradually restored, and symptoms relieved.\nThen, this patient was transferred to the Department of Cardiology for further evaluations and treatments.\nThe patient's blood pressure was 105/75 mm Hg upon admission, with a heart rate of 75 beats/min, body temperature of 36.6\u00b0C and respiration rate of 18 times/min.\nThe heart border extended to the left, with the apical impulse located in the left 5th intercostal space, 1.0\u200acm lateral to the midclavicular line.\nThe patient had a history of hypertension over 30 years without regular antihypertensive medication.\nThe highest blood pressure was 170/110 mm Hg.\nThere was no family history of early coronary artery disease or sudden cardiac death.\nHe did not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs, and rarely consumed alcohol.\nHe also reported no known contacts with sick persons and no recent travel.\nTwelve-lead surface electrocardiogram (ECG) of VT indicated that the origin of VT was at the boundary between right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) and tricuspid valve.\nWhen VT increased to 150 beats/min or higher, no epsilon waves were found in the precordial leads (Figure1A and B).\nIn contrast, when VT decreased to 120 beats/min or lower, epsilon waves appeared in leads V1\u2013V2 (Figure1C).\nNotably, the epsilon waves preceded QRS waves in leads V1\u2013V2, while endocardiac tracing confirmed that the corresponding local potential originating from RVOT appeared prior to the ventricular rhythm (Figure \u200b(Figure1D).1D).\nSinus ECG in the year of 2013 suggested a slight left deviation of electric axis, with a heart rate of 87 beats/min and flat T waves in lead II.\nT wave inversions were found in leads III, avF and V1\u2013V3, meanwhile epsilon waves were found following QRS complex in leads V1\u2013V3 (Figure \u200b(Figure2B).2B).\nWhen the lead avR was amplified, epsilon waves were also found behind QRS waves (Figure \u200b2C).\nAtrial premature beats appeared occasionally.\nMoreover, ventricular premature beats were also found to originate from the right ventricular apex, with epsilon waves appearing behind QRS waves (Figure \u200b(Figure2B).2B).\nIn contrast, sinus ECG obtained in the year of 1999 revealed similar left deviation of electric axis, flat T waves and T wave inversions, but absence of epsilon waves (Figure \u200b(Figure2A).2A).\nData from biochemical assays were as follows: cardiac troponin I level was 0.714\u200a\u03bcg/L (normal range, 0\u20130.06\u200a\u03bcg/L), serum B-type natriuretic peptide level was 466.530\u200apg/mL (normal range, 0\u2013100\u200apg/mL), serum d-dimer level was 8.14\u200amg/L (normal range,

44\u2013133\u200a\u03bcmol/L), serum uric acid level was 611.40\u200a\u03bcmol/L (normal range, 100\u2013432\u200a\u03bcmol/L), and endogenous creatinine clearing value was 57.90\u200amL/min (normal range, >80\u200amL/min).\nEcho data revealed remarkably enlarged right atrium and right ventricle, and widened ROVT.\nUncoordinated motions of the left and right ventricular walls were also detected.\nMoreover, we also found aortic valve degradation with slight regurgitation, slight mitral regurgitation, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation.\nThe left ventricular diastolic function was reduced to 55% (Figure \u200b3A and B).\nThe coronary angiogram revealed no vascular stenosis (Figure \u200b3C\u2013E).\nBased on the above-mentioned examinations, this patient met at least 2 major criteria, the bilateral ventricular dilation and the existence of epsilon waves, providing diagnostic support for ARVC.\nA diet with low salt and low fat was suggested.\nThe patient was also treated with metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets (23.75\u200amg daily, p.o.), amiodarone (200\u200amg daily, p.o.), furosemide (20\u200amg daily, i.v.), and compound \u03b1-ketoacid tablets (2.52\u200ag daily, p.o.).\nMoreover, VTs with different morphologies and cycle lengths were found during radiofrequency ablation (Figure 4).\nThe substrate voltage mapping revealed that the anterior wall of RVOT was wrapped by circular scar (Figure 5A).\nConsidering the association of VT with scar areas, substrate ablation was chosen for this patient.\nThe residual potentials in the scar areas were searched, and then linear and focal ablations were performed (Figure \u200b5B).\nNeither programmed stimulation nor induced stimulation could induce VT after the procedure was completed, indicating the success of operation.\nThe ECG after radiofrequency ablation showed sinus rhythm, with a heart rate of 61 beats/min, T wave inversions in leads III and avF, and epsilon waves and T wave inversions in leads V1\u2013V3 (Figure 2D).\nThis patient was discharged from hospital on day 9 with a regimen of metoprolol succinate sustained-release tablets (23.75\u200amg daily, p.o.), amiodarone hydrochloride tablets (200\u200amg daily, p.o.), spironolactone tablets (40\u200amg daily, p.o.), and fosinopril sodium tablets (10\u200amg daily, p.o.).\nThe patient was followed up 3 months after discharge.\nHe had no recurrent palpitation, chest tightness, profuse sweating or nausea.\nAlthough ARVC was the main diagnosis at the time of this patient's initial presentation, it is essential in

density on computed tomography (CT) imaging: complete response, disappearance of all lesions and no new lesions; partial response (PR), a decrease in size of 10% or a decrease in tumor density over 15% on CT and no new lesions; stable disease, not fit for complete response, PR, or progressive disease; and progressive disease, an increase in tumor size over 10% and not fit for PR by tumor density on CT or new lesions.[19]\nPreoperative MR imaging scan showed a mass of 2.8\u200a\u00d7\u200a3.5\u200acm in size close to the duodenum, pancreas, and blood vessels (Fig.1A).\nDuring substance phase,

with the power of 5\u200aW in 5 to 6 minutes.\nSubsequently, immediate ultrasonography showed that the whole lesion was covered with hyperechoic zone (Fig.\u200b(Fig.1E and F).\nHowever, the next day contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) revealed an abnormal residual of proximal part of the pancreatic head (Fig.2A).\nAt 5-day follow-up contrast-enhanced CT images, the lower mass had low signal intensity and upper tumor revealed intermediate high signal intensity of residual in substance phase (Fig.2B and C).\nSurprizingly, 1-week follow-up CEUS image showed an enlarged retroperitoneal lymph node located near the pancreatic head, which could be fusion of these residuary small nodules (Fig.2D).\nThen the patient undergoing the 2nd ablation with 2 laser fibers showed the lesions well-defined hyperechoic zone (Fig.2E and F).\nOn the 2nd day, postoperative CEUS images showed they were still remanent (Fig.2G and I).\nAt the corresponding MR imaging, it also showed this in left of tumor (Fig.2H).\nThus, the 3rd laser ablation was performed (Fig.2J)2J) and 3 days later CEUS found that there was still a minor lesion located in the separation gap of last 2 needles (Fig.3A).\nSubsequently the patient had the 4th ablation along this separation gap until hyperechoic overlay (Fig.3B\u2013D), then 3 days later, based on these 4 treatments, enhanced CT image of the retroperitoneal mass suggested complete necrosis (Fig.3E\u2013G).3E\u2013G).\nAfter the following 1 month, substance phase MR revealed low-intensity signal of tumor necrosis with resolution of his problems (Fig.3H).\nUntil 5 months after 4 ablations, CT showed the tumor PR with little enhanced recurrence (yellow arrows), which located in the left lower edge of original lesions (Fig.4A and B).\nOn laboratory test of tumor markers, the levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha fetoprotein, and carbohydrate antigen 19\u20139 indicated 3.6\u200ang/mL, 26.7\u200ang/mL, and 8.1\u200aU/mL,

with carboplatin and paclitaxel without disease response.\nMolecular analysis of tumor tissue was unavailable at that time.\nHowever, her demographic profile (Asian, minimal smoking history, non-small cell histology) predicted her disease would harbor EGFR TKI sensitive cells [2].\nTherefore, she then initiated standard daily dosing of erlotinib (150 mg) and her disease responded.\nTwenty-eight months later, she acquired resistance to erlotinib with progression of disease systemically.\nFollowing further progression through an experimental angiogenesis inhibitor, she initiated pemetrexed and resumed standard dose erlotinib.\nAfter initial response, 11 months later, her disease again progressed.\nDNA was extracted from biopsy of a progressing lung lesion and examined using established techniques for analysis of EGFR mutations [5].\nDirect sequencing of exons 18\u201321 encoding the kinase domain of EGFR revealed the L858R mutation associated with EGFR TKI sensitivity (Fig.1) [2].\nIt also demonstrated the T790M mutation associated with acquired EGFR TKI resistance (Fig.1) [2].\nShe also developed headaches and there was a high clinical suspicion of CNS metastases despite negative imaging (not shown).\nShe refused a lumbar puncture.\nShe initiated empiric temozolomide plus standard dose erlotinib (150 mg daily) for presumed CNS disease, but after one cycle her headaches worsened, and she developed nausea and vomiting concerning for CNS metastases with associated raised intracranial pressure.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain now demonstrated LM (Fig.2) confirmed by CSF cytology (not shown).\nBy direct sequencing, DNA from CSF cells harbored L858R predicting EGFR TKI sensitivity (Fig.3, left panel) but not the T790M resistance mutation (data not shown).\nBecause the result for T790M was negative in this sample, we performed a more sensitive fluorescence detection PCR-based assay that takes advantage of a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism generated by the specific missense mutation (Fig.3, right panel, arrow, positive control) [6].\nThat result was also negative, as only the wild type peak was detected (Fig.3, right panel, bottom).\nTherefore, we hypothesized that the LM remained sensitive to an EGFR TKI if sufficiently high concentrations of drug could be achieved in the CSF.\nThe erlotinib concentration required to inhibit growth of cell lines harboring L858R by 50% (IC50) is 100 nM (nM) [2].\nStandard dose erlotinib (150 mg daily) achieves 3000 nM in plasma [7], but CSF concentrations of EGFR TKIs are as low as 1% plasma levels below the IC50 [3, 8].\nIncreasing the daily dose of gefitinib to enhance CSF penetration has been an effective strategy [3], but gefitinib is no longer available in the United States following failure in phase III NSCLC trials.\nAn analogous increase of the daily erlotinib dose above 150\u2013200 mg daily induces unacceptable toxicity.\nHowever, weekly high-dose erlotinib up to 2000 mg is tolerable [4].\nPharmacokinetic analysis of CSF from another patient with NSCLC LM (not shown) treated with 1500 mg erlotinib weekly demonstrated a peak plasma concentration of 11,300 nM with a concurrent CSF concentration of 130 nM.\nTherefore, such high dose weekly administration of erlotinib achieved a CSF concentration exceeding the IC50.\nTherefore, to increase CSF penetrance over standard daily erlotinib dosing in this patient, we initiated high-dose weekly erlotinib at 1000 mg then 1200 mg; persistent nausea precluded higher doses.\nPharmacokinetic analysis was not undertaken in this patient.\nAfter 1 month there was a partial radiographic response of LM on brain MRI (Fig.2b) and after 2 months in the cauda equina (not shown).\nHowever, hydrocephalus and persistent symptoms referable to increased intracranial pressure led to a VP shunt and whole-brain radiation therapy, after which she resumed treatment with 1500 mg weekly erlotinib.\nOne month later,

cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio: 62.8%; Fig.1A), and an electrocardiogram showed a low QRS voltage at the limb leads.\nAn echocardiogram revealed a dilated and hypertrophied globular LV with a hypertrophied papillary muscle and hyper-trabeculation, which did not meet the criteria of LV non-compaction.\nThe other echocardiographic parameters were as follows: LV internal diameter at diastole, 37.7 mm (Z = 10.2); ejection fraction, 36.6%; and LV mass index, 75.6 g (Z = 6.3; Fig.1B).\nTo rule out the systemic cause of the dilated and hypertrophied LV, we performed a thoraco-abdominal computed tomographic (CT) angiography with contrast dye.\nThe CT findings showed no abnormality in the kidney and other organs and vessels.\nHowever, after undergoing CT angiography, the patient showed abrupt high-grade spiking fever (Fig.2) and developed secretory diarrhea (800 cc per day) associated with metabolic acidosis.\nAt this time, his WBC and neutrophil counts decreased to 3,290/\u00b5L and 1% (33/\u00b5L), respectively.\nThe B-natriuretic peptide level was greater than 4,901 pg/mL.\nHe did not show associated respiratory symptoms.\nThe results of the respiratory and gastrointestinal viral studies were negative, and the blood and stool cultures were negative for pathogens.\nThe C-reactive protein level was 7.08 mg/dL.\nDespite supportive care including intravenous fluid resuscitation and empirical antibiotics, the patient's condition worsened, with aggravated metabolic acidosis and respiratory difficulty, requiring transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nJust before the ICU transfer, the serum pH was 6.881; bicarbonate level, 7.8 mmol/L; and total CO2 was 41.4 mm Hg.\nAlthough the patient had been treated with intensive ventilator care, several inotropic agents, and other supportive care measures, he eventually died from the aggravated metabolic acidosis and acutely decompensated heart failure 7 days after the ICU care.\nDuring the stay in ICU, we performed genetic analysis for Barth syndrome from the evidence of displayed cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, and developmental delay.\nThe gene sequence analysis revealed that his TAZ gene harbored a novel hemizygous frameshift mutation, c.227delC (p.Pro76LeufsX7), which he inherited from his mother (Fig.3)."}}, {"_index": "casereport", "_type": "_doc", "_id": "26336183", "_score":

0.30\u20130.45 fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) of 23\u201345\u2005cm\u2005H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 7\u2005cm\u2005H2O, backup respiratory rate (RR) of 34).\nA chest X-ray of the thorax was performed on admission (figure 1A), and a month after the first surgery (figure 1B), showing improvement of the bilateral posterior atelectasis in the base of the lungs.\nOwing to the difficulty of progressing in the weaning process from mechanical ventilation after the VEPTRs were implanted to expand the thorax, a bronchoscopy was performed, showing bronchomalacia predominantly in both upper lobar bronchi.\nAs prolonged mechanical ventilation was expected, a tracheostomy was previously performed.\nAfter an initial CT scan (figure 2A), a follow-up CT scan (figure 2B) a month after the surgery showed a resolution of the posterior-basal atelectasis, coinciding with a decrease of FiO2 to 0.21.\nPostoperatively, the patient was on the Servo-i ventilator in a volume-controlled mode and needed variable PIPs between 25 and 45\u2005cm\u2005H2O and PEEP values of 7\u201311\u2005cm\u2005H2O.\nDuring the attempts to wean the patient off the ventilator in the following months, he was unable to activate the inspiratory flow trigger and required significant sedoanalgesia to adapt to the ventilator due to repeated episodes of desaturation, on some occasions with bradycardia, associated to bronchial collapse.\nHe continued to have asynchrony which required boluses of sedation in addition to existing medications.\nHe initially received fentanyl and midazolam through a continuous infusion pump with progressive increase in the doses as well as continuous cisatracurium as a muscular relaxant to adapt to mechanical ventilation (figure 3).\nAs clinical stabilisation was achieved, the muscular relaxant was withdrawn and a progressive decrease of sedation was initiated along with a change in the drug regimen.\nDuring this period, the patient developed an ocular flutter which was attributed to a pharmacological cause after neurological alterations were ruled out with normal EEG, ophthalmoscopy, metabolic workup and cranial MRI.\nAt 5\u2005months of age, the NAVA mode started to improve the patient's adaptation to the ventilator through the use of a neural trigger.\nThe NAVA catheter additionally costs around \u20ac200 per catheter; according to the manufacturer it should be changed every 5\u2005days.\nIt was required for 7\u2005months; nevertheless the catheters were changed every 15\u2005days without observing a deterioration of the Edi signal.\nAccording to the literature, Jarcho-Levin syndrome does not appear with mental retardation and life expectancy is pretty long, so ethically, we considered that this patient should have an opportunity to overcome his thoracic insufficiency if it were technically possible.\nTachypnoea was initially observed with a RR of 55 without other signs of increase in his work of breathing and his RR eventually returned to normal for his age (40) over the next few days.\nThe synchrony achieved with the ventilator allowed a progressive decrease of the sedoanalgesia he received until it was completely withdrawn in 10\u2005days; and the need for extra boluses of sedation was reduced to zero.\nConcurrently to the reduction of sedation, his ocular flutter disappeared and he showed significant progress in his psychomotor development.\nThe settings used were: NAVA level of 1\u2005cm\u2005H2O/\u00b5V, PEEP 11\u2005cm\u2005H2O, Edi trigger 0.5\u2005\u00b5V.\nThe patient had tidal volumes (Vt) of 6\u20137\u2005mL/kg (figure 3).\nAfter 10\u2005days on the NAVA mode, he did not require any type of sedation and the sporadic episodes of bronchial collapse were resolved with a quick increase of PEEP to 20\u2005cm\u2005H2O or manual ventilation with the self-inflating bag.\nOnce he was stabilised on the NAVA mode, his PIPs oscillated between 15 and 45\u2005cm\u2005H2O with a NAVA level of 0.4 and Edi peaks between 15 and 100\u2005\u00b5V.\nA posterior pulmonary CT scan performed 2\u2005months after the first surgery, 1\u2005month after starting NAVA and prior to the first thoracic expansion, showed a significant reduction in the posterobasal atelectases previously observed (figure 2B).\nWhen he turned 1\u2005year old, after several attempts with different devices Trilogy 100 (Philips), Astral 150 (ResMed), the patient finally tolerated mechanical ventilation with a home ventilator (Monnal T-50, Air Liquide) in a volume assisted/controlled mode with the following settings: Vt 80\u2005mL (9\u2005mL/kg), PEEP 10\u2005cm\u2005H2O, flow trigger 0.5\u2005L/min.\nHis PIPs were around 30\u2005cm\u2005H2O.\nHe did not tolerate a decrease of PEEP below 9\u2005cm\u2005H2O or short disconnections from the ventilator.\nCurrently, the patient is 19\u2005months old, is able to walk and

calcifications.\nThe appearance was probably due to a craniopharyngioma or haemorrhagic pituitary adenoma.\nThe patient was referred urgently to the neurosurgery unit and was found to have markedly raised prolactin levels of greater than 200\u2005000\u2005mIU/L, confirming the diagnosis of a giant prolactinoma.\nIn cooperation with the local endocrinology service, he was started on cabergoline

abnormalities, such as severe brain swelling, intracranial hemorrhage, or cerebral infarction (Fig.2C).\nBecause a possible cerebral infarction could not be excluded within 24\u200ahours, glucocorticoid, mannitol, and a vasodilator were used.\nThe patient's routine laboratory results for blood cell, liver, and renal functions were in relatively normal ranges.\nThe albumin was 33\u200ag/L, the TBil was 13.3\u200a\u03bcmol/L, and the DBil was 4.5\u200a\u03bcmol/L.\nALT was 12\u200aU/L, and the INR for coagulation values was 1.01.\nBecause of her history of UGH, we checked her blood ammonia levels and performed a fecal occult blood test and blood gas analysis.\nHer blood ammonia was elevated (181.6\u200a\u03bcmol/L; normal range is 11\u201332\u200a\u03bcmol/L), whereas the fecal occult blood test was positive.\nThus, considering her history and elevated blood ammonia, she was diagnosed with UGH-induced hepatic encephalopathy, and the oral administration of VPA was changed to intravenous administration to prevent seizures.\nLactulose, vitamin B, and L-arginine were administered, clysis with vinegar was performed, and the patient was fasted.\nThe patient's blood ammonia level fluctuated (144.8\u2013207.7\u200a\u03bcmol/L), and she remained unconscious during the following 3 days.\nBecause of the unremarkable progress in the patient's mental state and blood ammonia level, we held a multidisciplinary conference to discuss diagnosis and treatment, initially considering hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.\nAfter the multidisciplinary discussion, a suspected diagnosis of VHE was finally made, even though the blood VPA level was within the normal range.\nWe decided to stop VPA administration before performing any dialysis and administered levetiracetam instead of VPA.\nThe patient's blood VPA and ammonia levels were then routinely monitored.\nThe patient's mental state began to improve from the first 24\u200ahours of VPA discontinuation, and she achieved complete consciousness within 48\u200ahours (GCS\u200a=\u200a15).\nThe ammonia levels in her blood decreased dramatically and returned to normal within 4 days (Fig.3).\nOn postoperative day 15 (8 days after the discontinuation of VPA), the patient was discharged with no complications.\nThe follow-up interviews in postoperative month 5 witnessed her full consciousness and non-recurrence of the primary tumor (Fig.2D).\nThe patient's GCS score was 15, and she reported enjoying a satisfying quality of postoperative life."}}, {"_index": "casereport",

pancreaticoduodenectomy with complete surgical resection of a 5cm moderately differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\nAlthough our patient underwent complete surgical resection, a pathological examination revealed a neoplastic invasion of the resected adjacent organs, and one out of the seven resected lymph nodes contained cancer (T3N1M0).\nAt that point, the oncology department recommended to proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1000mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, 15 on a 28-day cycle for six cycles) to try to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.\nHowever, after completing two cycles (a total of six doses) of chemotherapy, he presented to the emergency department with worsening exertional dyspnea, three-pillow orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and fatigue.\nHis physical examination revealed an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) (10cm above the sternal angle), bibasilar rales and  2 pitting edema of both lower extremities.\nCardiac auscultation revealed a gallop rhythm with an S3 and a grade 3 holosystolic murmur over precordium.\nA chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly with mild to moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion.\nIt was thought that his presentation was consistent with fluid overload secondary to congestive heart failure (CHF) and he was started on intravenous (IV) furosemide with partial improvement in his symptoms.\nThe next day, a two-dimensional echocardiography (2D Echo) was performed, which showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 15 to 20 percent with global hypokinesia along with moderate mitral regurgitation.\nGiven the findings of 2D Echo and the absence of significant risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (CMP), it was concluded that our patient\u2019s CMP was related to the recent use of gemcitabine.\nOur patient was then started on carvedilol and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in addition to diuretics and he was discharged from the hospital two days later in a euvolemic state.\nAt that point, the cardiology department recommended stopping further chemotherapy with gemcitabine.\nThe oncology department advised further testing to rule out ischemia as a cause of CMP as, in their opinion, chemotherapy with gemcitabine was the only option to reduce the risk of recurrence in this patient.\nTwo weeks later, our patient underwent myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), which showed a fixed small- to moderate-sized inferior wall defect without any evidence of active ischemia.\nThe ejection fraction (EF) on MPI was calculated to be around 17 to 20 percent with severe global hypokinesia.\nOur patient was continued on standard heart failure therapy with one more admission to the hospital for CHF exacerbation about two months later.\nHe responded well to IV furosemide and adjustment of heart failure therapy.\nA 2D Echo was repeated a few months later and it showed improvement in systolic function with an LVEF of 40 percent.\nDue to his poor functional status and underlying CMP, further gemcitabine chemotherapy was stopped.\nLater, our patient developed a recurrence of his pancreatic cancer; he refused further chemotherapy and decided to proceed with palliative care.\nAlthough the exact etiology of our patient\u2019s dilated cardiomyopathy remains unclear, gemcitabine remains the most likely culprit.\nThe temporal relationship of his symptoms to the initiation of gemcitabine chemotherapy; the lack of risk factors for ischemic CMP and prior history of CAD, finding of global hypokinesia on 2D Echo, absence of ischemia on MPI; and improvement in his systolic function after discontinuation of gemcitabine were all consistent with gemcitabine-induced cardiomyopathy."}}, {"_index": "casereport",

to the regional hospital with another episode of saturnine colic (blood lead: 113.2\u200a\u03bcg/dL), and chelation therapy with EDTA (4 days before the admission in our clinic) was initiated, with a

specialist, who recommended the continuation of chelation therapy with EDTA, increasing the dose at 4\u200atablets/day.\nWe also required a neurological consultation, and the specialist established the diagnosis of behavioral disorders with depressive elements, and recommended psychotherapy.\nBased on all these clinical and laboratory findings, we established the diagnosis of lead poisoning.\nWe initiated an intense i.v. hydration in order to favor lead elimination, approximately 3 liters per 24\u200ahours initially, and we decreased progressively the quantity once she ceased to vomit, and she was able to consume liquids.\nWe associated diuretics, initially furosemide by vein, but the values of the arterial pressure persisted above the upper limit, therefore we were forced to introduce also an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, with the remission of arterial hypertension.\nRegarding the liver function, we administered amino acids intravenously, associated with liver protectors

discharged without any complaints, and we recommended no further exposure to lead, avoiding the contact and the working in the pottery process.\nThe long-term outcome of this case depends on further exposure to this heavy metal.\nNevertheless, we intend to repeat the blood lead levels after 12 and 24 months, assessing also the renal (urea, creatinine, urinary exam) and hepatic functions (ASAT,

during a 2-day period), he passed soft stools once daily, and his body weight decreased to 47 kg so he came to our hospital again 3 weeks after the resumption of olmesartan for treatment.\nHis vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 35.1\u2103; pulse rate, 93/min; and blood pressure, 132/75 mmHg.\nThe neurologic findings showed no worsening of his symptoms.\nThe laboratory findings were as follows: sodium level, 139 mEq/L; potassium level, 2.9 mEq/L; and chlorine level, 116 mEq/L.\nHyperchloremia was noted, and the serum sodium level minus chloride level (139-116) was 23 mEq/L; additionally, the arterial blood gas findings were as follows: pH, 7.25; PCO2, 25 mmHg, and HCO3, 11 mmol/L.\nThe urinalysis findings were as follows: sodium level, 15 mEq/L; potassium level, 13 mEq/L; chlorine level, 100 mEq/L; and urine anion gap, -72 mEq/L, and there was no apparent increase in bowel movements; however, this seemed to be due to the absence of HCO3- from the gastrointestinal tract (6).\nPlain abdominal radiography and abdominal computed tomography findings revealed the continuous dilation of the entire intestinal tract (Fig.2); therefore, the patient was diagnosed with intestinal pseudo-obstruction.\nAfter discontinuing olmesartan, the nausea and body weight decreases were promptly ameliorated.\nDuodenal biopsy findings after discontinuing olmesartan showed that the inflammation observed before discontinuation as well as the fold structure had both clearly ameliorated (Fig.3)."}}]
